"""Antigravity provider — the CLI states the quota, the journal proves a block.

Antigravity exposes no usage file: its conversation stores are protobuf blobs
and its settings carry only UI state. Two sources exist, and they are very
unequal:

0. **Antigravity CLI** (``agy -p "/usage" --output-format json``) — the real
   answer. It returns every quota pool with an exact remaining fraction and
   reset timestamp, answered locally in print mode (its changelog: "without
   starting an agent turn, spending quota, or leaving a conversation behind";
   measured: the conversation count does not change). Requires ``agy``
   installed and logged in.

   Antigravity bills more than Google's own models: the payload carries one
   group per INDEPENDENT pool — ``Gemini Models`` (Gemini Flash/Pro) and
   ``Claude and GPT models`` (Claude Opus/Sonnet, GPT-OSS) — each with its own
   weekly + 5h pair. Those pools do not constrain each other, so every window
   keeps its ``group`` and gating never crosses pools: a spent Claude weekly
   must not zero a Gemini 5h window the user can still spend.

1. **Brain refusal journal** (``brain/<conv>/.system_generated/messages``) — the
   fallback when the CLI is absent. Antigravity records the backend's own 429
   with the exact reset delay (see :mod:`._antigravity_brain`), which proves a
   block but never a percentage.

So without the CLI this provider reports exactly two honest states: a refusal
whose reset is still ahead (the window is SPENT until that instant, the
provider's own verdict), or ``UNAVAILABLE`` — quota unknown, not free.
Inventing a percentage is precisely what the subsystem forbids.

Right after a block's reset elapses the window is reported once more, so the
model's elapsed-reset pass (``apply_elapsed_resets``) can render it refilled and
the "limit reset" alert can fire. That grace is deliberately short: the refill
is derived from the provider's clock, and once it has been announced FastPrompter
has no way to know what was spent since, so it goes back to saying so.
