"""Provider adapter interface for usage-limit probing.

Every provider implements the same three-method contract — discover
accounts, probe one account in isolation, report capabilities. No Qt,
no GUI state. See ``codex.py`` for a reference implementation, ``claude.py``
for the honest-unsupported fallback.
